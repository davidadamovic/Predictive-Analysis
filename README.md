# 🎓 Predictive Analysis for Early Identification of Support Needs in High School Students

This project uses **machine learning and deep learning** to predict early support needs among high school students, based on their socio-economic background, behavior, and academic performance during the first year.

The project is written in **Python**, and the report/documentation is in **Swedish**.

## 📊 Project Summary

Using the **Student Alcohol Consumption dataset** from Kaggle, this project aims to identify students at risk of academic underperformance and in need of extra support.

### 🔍 Goals:
1. Predict if a student will need support based on grade, behavior, and background.
2. Achieve an F1-score above 50% on the "at-risk" class without data augmentation.

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- **Python 3.11**
- **TensorFlow / Keras (Sequential API)**
- **Keras Tuner** for hyperparameter optimization
- **Pandas / NumPy** for data manipulation
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** for visualizations

## 🧪 Results & Limitations

Despite experimenting with neural network tuning, the results were limited due to:
- Class imbalance in the target variable (low-performing students)
- Limited dataset size (~382 students)
- Lack of data 

**Best F1-score 0:** 43%

## 📈 Potential Applications

- Early intervention tools for educators
- Resource planning for municipalities
- Statistical dashboards for school administration
